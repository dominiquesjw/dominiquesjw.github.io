# PacMan-Exercise

Description

PacMan is my week4 assignment for the MIT full stack coding program. The project animates PacMan to move from one side of the screen to the other end and change the direction when it reaches to the edge of the browser screen. It comes with four images of PacMan in different states:mouth open facing right, mouth closed facing right, mouth open facing left and mouth closed facing left. The constant switch of these images make PacMan look like eating with its mouth open and closed. 

Installation

The code can run in a browser environment. Once loaded, the animation starts with a mouse click on the PacMan.

Roadmap

A function Run is implemented to enable PacMan to move and a function checkPageBounds is created to ensure PacMan reverses its direction when hitting the edge of the browser screen.
